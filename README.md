# CARLA + ROS2 Navigation Stack
## AVL Mentor Project - Professional Autonomous Navigation Pipeline

![Hero Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arassal/carla-nav2-avl/main/assets/hero-banner.svg)

Professional autonomous navigation research platform combining CARLA 0.10.0, ROS2 Humble, and Navigation2 stack. This is a **production-grade implementation** designed for seamless sim-to-real transfer to actual vehicle hardware.

## 🎯 Project Vision

**Sim-to-Real Autonomous Driving**: Develop, test, and validate autonomous navigation algorithms in high-fidelity CARLA simulation using the **exact same camera and sensor layout** as our physical vehicle, then deploy the identical ROS2 stack to real hardware.

![Sim-to-Real Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arassal/carla-nav2-avl/main/assets/sim-to-real-pipeline.svg)

This approach eliminates the traditional "sim-to-real gap" by ensuring hardware and software parity from day one.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

![Complete Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arassal/carla-nav2-avl/main/assets/architecture-advanced.svg)

The system is organized in **4 distinct layers**:

1. **Hardware Layer** - GPU, cameras, lidar, compute platform
2. **ROS2 Middleware** - DDS messaging, transform trees, standard message types
3. **Navigation2 Stack** - Costmaps, planners, controllers, safety
4. **Application Layer** - CARLA simulation, custom nodes, visualization

Each layer is **hardware-agnostic**, allowing the same code to run in CARLA and on real vehicles with minimal changes.

## 🔄 Development Pipeline

![Deployment Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arassal/carla-nav2-avl/main/assets/deployment-workflow.svg)

### Phase 1: Simulation Development
1. Setup CARLA environment and ROS2 bridge
2. Configure Navigation2 stack and tune parameters
3. Implement custom nodes (localization, planning)
4. Add safety modules (traffic lights, emergency brake)
5. Integration testing and validation
6. Document all parameters and calibration values

### Phase 2: Validation & Testing
- Lane following across multiple towns and speeds
- Obstacle detection and emergency braking
- Traffic light recognition and enforcement
- Dynamic scenarios (weather, traffic, pedestrians)
- Parameter optimization
- Sign-off for real-world deployment

### Phase 3: Real-World Deployment
1. Hardware integration (cameras, lidar, CAN bus)
2. Camera calibration (intrinsics, extrinsics, sync)
3. Software deployment on vehicle
4. Closed-loop vehicle control testing
5. Real-world validation (parking lot → streets → highway)
6. Parameter refinement and edge case handling
7. **Production Ready** ✓
